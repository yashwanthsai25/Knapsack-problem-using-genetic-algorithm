# Knapsack-problem-using-genetic-algorithm
The algorithm starts by creating 100 random arrays with size 5. This array consists of binary values 0's and 1's. The selection method runs after the initialization and selects the best 50 arrays with the best fitness. The best fitness is a method which checks each array for the correspondence weight and profit. Those two arrays contain the weight and the profit for each index of the parents array which is 1. Now the mutation method randomizes those arrays for optimization purposes. In this case, my method generates random numbers for each index for each array with range 0,1. Then it checks if the value is less than 0.5 and if true, it swaps the index from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. Next method which takes place in the running time is the crossover which mixes two parents (arrays) and makes children. The purpose of this method is to create back 100 parents for further iteration of the algorithm as well as find the optimal value of profits we are looking for. The program stops when we found the optimal value otherwise generates again new children until it finds the optimal.
